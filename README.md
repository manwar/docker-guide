# Docker Guide


### What is Docker?

  - Virtualization Software
  - Makes developing and deploying applications easier
  - Packages application with all dependencies
  - Easily shared and distributed

### Development process using containers

  - Own isolated environment
  - Start service as a Docker container using command e.g. docker run postgres
  - The command is same for all OS
  - Same command for all services e.g. docker run redis

Docker standardizes process of running any service on any local dev environment.

It is easier to run different versions of same application without any conflicts.

### Deployment process using containers

  - First we need to have Docker runtime on the server, one time only
  - Then run Docker command to fetch and run the Docker artifacts

### Virtual Machine vs Docker

To understand this, let's explore how an OS is made up. There are 2 main layers:

  - OS Kernel
  - OS Application Layer

OS Kernel layer is responsible to interact with the hardware.

Kernel is at the core of every OS. It interacts between hardware and software components.

  OS Application Layer <=> OS Kernel <=> Hardware

VM is also a virtualization tool but they differ in what part of OS do they virtualize.

Docker virtualize the OS Application Layer.

A docker contains OS application layer. Also services and apps installed on top of that layer. 

It uses the kernel of the host as it doesn't have it's own kernel.

A virtual machine contains OS application layer and OS kernel. 

It doesn't use host kernel, instead it uses it's own kernel.

    VM1: App A, Guest OS 1
    VM2: App B, Guest OS 2

Docker images are much smaller as it doesn't have its own kernel

Docker containers take seconds to start as VM take minutes

VM is compatible with all OS i.e. of Windows host OS, we can Linux guest OS and MacOS

Docker is only compatible with Linux distros

##### Virtual Machine

    - Hardware
    - Host OS e.g. Ubuntu    
    - Hypervisor e.g VMWare
      - Ubuntu (VM)
      - CentOS (VM)
      - Debian (VM)

##### Docker

    - Hardware
    - Host OS e.g. Ubuntu
    - Docker Engine
      - Ubuntu (Docker Image)
      - CentOS (Docker Image)
      - Debian (Docker Image)

The docker container is like a micro computer havin

### Docker Desktop

It allows to run Linux containers on Windows or MacOS.
It uses a Hypervisor layer with a lightweight Linux distro.

### Install Docker

You can download the docker from the official website and follow the instructions of your OS.

For me, I am running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS in WSL2.

I found this [**installation guide**](https://gist.github.com/dehsilvadeveloper/c3bdf0f4cdcc5c177e2fe9be671820c7) very handy.

It worked like a charm for me.

#### Step 1: Update the system

    $ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
	
#### Step 2: Install dependencies

    $ sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
	
#### Step 3: Add Docker GPG Key

    $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
	
#### Step 4: Add the Docker Repository

    $ echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
	
#### Step 5: Install Docker Engine	

    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
	
#### Step 6: Add yourself to Docker Group

Add your user to the Docker group to avoid the need to use sudo on every Docker command:

    $ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
	
#### Step 7: Restart WSL via the Windows command line (Powershell).

    > wsl --shutdown	
	
#### Step 8: Access Ubuntu again. Check if Docker was installed correctly on the Ubuntu terminal:

    $ docker --version
    Docker version 28.0.1, build 068a01e

### Docker Images vs Docker Containers

Docker image is an executable application artifact. It includes app source code but also complete environment configutation. 
We can add environment variables, create directories, files etc.

Once docker image is downloaded and run. It starts the application. 
The running instance of an image is called Docker container.

From one docker image, we can run multiple containers.

To list docker images:

    $ docker images
    REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID   CREATED   SIZE
    $

To list docker containers:

    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
    $ 

 ### Docker Registry

 As we now know that we run containers from images.

 How do we get these images?

Docker Registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker images.

Docker hosts one of the biggest Docker Registry called [**Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com).

You don't need to sign up to browse and lookup docker images on docker hub.

Every docker images comes with tag i.e. version.

To download a docker image, use the command `docker pull {name}:{tag}`

    $ docker pull nginx:1.27

Now if we list docker images, we should have one.

    $ docker images
    REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
    nginx        1.27      b52e0b094bc0   4 weeks ago   192MB

If we don't mention the tag when pulling docker image then it would download the latest.

    $ docker pull nginx
    $ docker images
    REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
    nginx        1.27      b52e0b094bc0   4 weeks ago   192MB
    nginx        latest    b52e0b094bc0   4 weeks ago   192MB

How how do we run the image and create a container?

    $ docker run nginx:1.27

We have a container running now.

Open up a new terminal and type the command below:

    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE        COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
    518dddf21a2d   nginx:1.27   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   13 seconds ago   Up 12 seconds   80/tcp    kind_grothendieck

In the other terminal where we ran the command `docker run nginx:127`, container logs still blocking the control.

Let's cancel the run `CTRL + c`.

Now run the below command, no container is running now:

    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE        COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
    $	

To avoid the docker log blocking the terminal, we can run the container and detach as well.

    $ docker run -d nginx:1.27
    3f35dc78986b4c1fe172005b3cc650e978804131d71706ce30609ff02e7457cf
    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE        COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
    3f35dc78986b   nginx:1.27   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   13 seconds ago   Up 12 seconds   80/tcp    kind_grothendieck

If you want to inspect the docker log then you use command `docker logs <container_id>`.

    $ docker logs 3f35dc78986b	

We can run the container without manually pulling the docker image.

Below we want to run `nginx 1.23`, which we don't have it locally.

It will look up locally first and when it can't find then it would go and pull it for you.

    $ docker run -d nginx:1.23

Now if we check the containers, we see two containers running.

    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE        COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
    beb858459a56   nginx:1.23   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   3 seconds ago    Up 2 seconds    80/tcp    stoic_lumiere
    3f35dc78986b   nginx:1.27   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   55 minutes ago   Up 55 minutes   80/tcp    vigorous_elbakyan

### Container Port vs Host Port

Application inside the container runs in an isolated Docker network.
 
This allows us to run the same app running on the same port multiple times.

We need to expose the container port to the host.

#### Port Binding

     Bind the container's port to the host's port to make the service
     available to the outside world.

Every application runs on specific port e.g. nginx runs on port 80, redis runs on port 6379.

You can get this information when you type `docker ps` command.

If we try to reach port 80 outside the container as in the browser `http://localhost:80` then you would get error `The site can't be reached`

Let's stop the container first:

    $ docker stop 3f35dc78986b

Now we would run the container with port binding like below:

    $ docker run -d -p 9000:80 nginx:1.27

Check the container status

    $ docker run -d -p 9000:80 nginx:1.27
    bf4e2dc18a602ecc067a72e1ea076068deb26e0d4000c506a41d6aeb0047dba1
    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE        COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                     NAMES
    bf4e2dc18a60   nginx:1.27   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   2 seconds ago   Up 2 seconds   0.0.0.0:9000->80/tcp, [::]:9000->80/tcp   reverent_ellis
    $

Check in the browser if you can access the nginx: `http://localhost:9000`

You can check the containers log:

    $ docker logs bf4e2dc18a60

Generally it is advisable to port bind the same port. 

    $ docker stop bf4e2dc18a60
    $ docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx:1.27
    bf4e2dc18a602ecc067a72e1ea076068deb26e0d4000c506a41d6aeb0047dba1
    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE        COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                   NAMES
    bf4e2dc18a60   nginx:1.27   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   2 seconds ago   Up 2 seconds   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, [::]:9000->80/tcp   reverent_ellis
    $

**NOTE**

Docker run command creates a new container everytime and doesn't re-use the previous container.

We have executed `docker run`  multiple times but when we do `docker ps`  it only shows one. 

However those containers still exist.

     $ docker ps -a

To remove the container:

     $ docker rm bf4e2dc18a60

To stop all containers:

     $ docker stop $(docker ps -q)

To remove all containers:

     $ docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

You can even start the container that we stopped earlier, rather than creating a new.

     $ docker start bf4e2dc18a60

You can give a name to a container:

    $ docker run --name nginx-1 -d -p 9000:80 nginx:1.27
    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE        COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                     NAMES
    5058136e20a2   nginx:1.27   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   4 seconds ago   Up 4 seconds   0.0.0.0:9000->80/tcp, [::]:9000->80/tcp   nginx-1

### Registry vs Repository

Docker Registry is a service providing storage and can be hosted by a third party like AWS or by yourself. 

It is also a collection of repositories.

Docker Repository is collection of related images with the same name but different versions.

`Docker Hub` is a registry.

On Docker Hub, you can have private or public repositories for your application.

### Create docker image

`Dockerfile` can be used to create docker image.

Let's build a simple `Hello World` program in `Python`.

We would create `app.py`

    print("Hello, World!")

Now we create another file `Dockerfile` as below:

    # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
    FROM python:3.14-rc-bookworm

    # Set the working directory in the container
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
    COPY app.py /app

    # Run app.py when the container launches
    CMD ["python", "app.py"]

Build the image:

    $ docker build -t my-python-app .

Run the container:

    $ docker run my-python-app

We can create an image as above but this time using `docker-compose`.

For this we would need to install `docker-compose`:

    $ sudo apt install docker-compose

Create a file `docker-compose.yml`

    version: '3.8'

    services:
      my-python-app:
        build: .
        container_name: my-python-app-container

The `version: '3.8'`, specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format.

The `services:`, defines the services that will be run.

`my-python-app`, the name of the service.

`build: .`, tells Docker Compose to build the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory.

`container_name: my-python-app-container`, specifies the name of the container.

Now build and run the container:

    $ docker-compose up

Stop the container:

    $ docker-compose down

### Docker Compose

It's a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

Without docker-compose, you start 2 docker containers

1) Create a docker network

    $ docker network create mongo-network
    $ docker network ls

2) Start MongoDB container

       $ docker run -d \
         -p 27017:27017 \
         -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin \
         -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=supersecret \
         --network mongo-network \
         --name mongodb \
         mongo
       $ docker ps

3) Start Mongo Express Container

       $ docker run -d \
         -p 8081:8081 \
         -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=admin \
         -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=supersecret \
         -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongodb \
         --network mongo-network \
         --name mongo-express \
         mongo-express
       $ docker ps

Open browser and visit `http://localhost:8081`

Get the credentials `admin:pass` from docker logs

    $ docker logs mongo-express

As we see, we have 2 containers i.e. Mongo Express dependent on MongoDB.

In the above example, we run 2 containers on the same docker network. 

It works just fine, if you have 2-3 containers.

With `docker-compose`, we create a single `YAML` configuration file for all application services.

Also you create and start all the services with a single command.

Let's convert docker commands to docker compose configuration.

Here is the `docker-compose.yaml` file:

    version: '3.8'
    services:
      mongodb:
        image: mongo
        ports:
          - 27017:27017
        environment:
          MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin
          MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=supersecret

      mongo-express:
        image: mongo-express
        ports:
          - 8081:8081
        environment:
          ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=admin
          ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=supersecret
          ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongodb

Missing network name in the configuration?

Well, `docker-compose` sets up a single network for the application.

Now stop all containers first and then remove.

    $ docker stop mongodb mongo-express
    $ docker rm mongodb mongo-express
    $ docker network rm mongo-network

Check network afterwards:

    $ docker network ls

Check no container running:

    $ docker ps

Now start the containers:

    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up

If you want to see the default network created by `docker-compose` then do this:

    $ docker network ls

Check the containers, you should see 2 in the list.

    $ docker ps

You will notice one thing, that logs of both containers are mixed up.

You can also configure the dependency in the docker compose file like below:

    version: '3.8'
    services:
      mongodb:
        image: mongo
        ports:
          - 27017:27017
        environment:
          MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin
          MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=supersecret

      mongo-express:
        image: mongo-express
        ports:
          - 8081:8081
        environment:
          ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=admin
          ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=supersecret
          ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongodb
        depends_on:
          - "mongodb"

Go to the browser in `Mongo Express` application. create a database and inside create a collection.

You should check the log showing all activities.

If you want to run docker compose in `detach` mode, do this:

    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d

To shutdown all services, do this:

    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml down

If you noticed, it not only stopped the containers but also removed it too.

It also removed the network as well.

    $ docker ps -a

**NOTE:** If you remove the container, you loose all the changes done in the container. By default, no persistence happens.

However if you stop the container and start again, you still have all the changes.

So you would do something like below:

Did you notice `start` and not `up` to start the container?

Also `stop` and NOT `down` to stop the container?

    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml start -d
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml stop

Let's add a document in the collection `my-collection` we created above in the database `my-db`.

    {
       "_id": ObjectId(),
       "myid": 1,
       "data": "some dynamic data loaded from DB"
    }
    
We would try to fetch this document in the `JS` application.

Let's add a simple JS application to interact with the MongoDB.

[**Source**](https://gitlab.com/twn-youtube/docker-compose-crash-course) for the JS application.

Get the clone of the above repository locally.

Copy the `docker-compose.yaml` file we created above inside the root folder of the repository.

Now we will edit the docker compose file to add the JS application:

We are building image as we don't have image for JS application using the `Dockerfile` in the root folder.

    version: '3.8'
    services:
      my-app:
        build: .
        ports:
          - 3000:3000
        environment:
          MONGO_DB_USERNAME=admin
          MONGO_DB_PWD=supersecret

      mongodb:
        image: mongo
        ports:
          - 27017:27017
        environment:
          MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin
          MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=supersecret

      mongo-express:
        image: mongo-express
        ports:
          - 8081:8081
        environment:
          ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=admin
          ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=supersecret
          ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongodb
        depends_on:
          - "mongodb"

First stop all containers:

    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml stop
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
